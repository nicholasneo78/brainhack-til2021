## File naming guideline
<test_score>-<your_initials>-<file_name>   
   
Submission Folder in GDrive(Use the gmail you signed up for TIL2021):   
[GDrive Sumbission Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10OoLP4nd-f9uWzkykw1w_4XzCxLFfqUj/view?usp=sharing)
   
If no <test_score> appended also can, anyone free can upload to gdrive also  
   
<your initials>: nn, mia, sy, kj, ky  
<file_name> please put the configurations you have done (refer to the example file in each challenge folder)   

Have fun :)
